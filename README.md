# RC Actually

> "If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that [RC] actually is all around."

There are a lot of Recursers these days! This toy extension puts a little RC logo next to links to the profiles of RCers on Twitter and Github.

## Installation

### Chrome
1. Clone repo.
2. Open [Extensions settings](chrome://extensions/)
3. Turn on "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
5. Select `crx` folder in cloned repo.


## Use
1. Populate the list of usernames by visiting the RC People page (If you don't have access to that page, you may have success [requesting it here](https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat))
2. Visit a Twitter or Github page. If there are RCer profiles linked, you should see a little RC logo next to them :)


## Suggested enhancements
* Run during other DOM changes -- currently only runs on page load
* Safari extension!
* Firefox extension!
* Code quality/extension best practice PRs (This is my first browser extension!)
